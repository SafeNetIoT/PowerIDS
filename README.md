# Catching Hackers by Watching Watts: A Measurement Study of Power-Only Attack Detection on Consumer IoT Devices

This repository contains the code and analysis used in the study Catching Hackers by Watching Watts.
The project investigates whether network attacks on consumer IoT devices can be recognised from power consumption signals alone.
Power traces and background traffic are collected in a controlled testbed, converted into lightweight statistical features and classified at window level.
The analysis explores detection feasibility, activity induced masking and the physical and network factors that influence reliability.
